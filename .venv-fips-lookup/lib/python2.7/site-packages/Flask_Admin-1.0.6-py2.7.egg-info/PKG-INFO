        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Flask-Admin is advanced, extensible and simple to use administrative interface building extension for Flask framework.
        
        It comes with batteries included: model scaffolding for `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_,
        `MongoEngine <http://mongoengine.org/>`_, MongoDB and `Peewee <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee>`_ ORMs, simple
        file management interface and a lot of usage samples.
        
        You're not limited by the default functionality - instead of providing simple scaffolding for the ORM
        models, Flask-Admin provides tools that can be used to construct administrative interfaces of any complexity,
        using a consistent look and feel.
